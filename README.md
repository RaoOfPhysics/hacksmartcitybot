# SmartCoTeam

Team up with your colleagues to become Geneva's healthiest company and make Geneva a smarter city

## What is SmartCoTeam?

Compete with Geneva's biggest organisations to determine who uses the most environmentally friendly and healthy means of getting to work.
Each organisation or company that wants to participate installs three NFC tags on their campus, corresponding to:

- Car
- TPG
- Bike
- Walking

Every day, when you get to work, use your NFC-enabled phone to scan the tag corresponding to the means of transport you used.
Your scores anonymously get added to the tally of your company.
The scores for each company is weighted by the number of people participating, so you will get a *per-capita* ranking.
The relative rankings of the three means of transport are: Car << TPG << Bike. You get the most points for taking a bike to work.

## Your customised NFC tags

Each participating organisation will be provided with the NFC tags to install on site.
These tags will be write-protected, so that they cannot be tamperred with.
A unique ID will be assigned to the NFC tag to group participating team members.
When you scan a tag, a browser launches to ping a server that enters the appropriate means of transport.

## The Telegram bot

If you want to receive the scores for your team or for all participating companies, you can call upon your friendly neighbourhood Telegram bot.
You can set up the bot to automatically ping you with the scores for the last week or month, or you can manually ask it for the scores.

## LICENCE

TBD, but it will be some copyleft one.
